# Project: Digital Rolling Ball Clock (Internship-python-3)  
  
---  
  
## Project Description  
  
Scenario: I am a Senior Python Developer at Simco Technical Services, Inc. (a fictional company). The Product Research and Development team has determined that the market is ready for a digital [Rolling Ball Clock](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15_C74u_wXJQODbTN7GIjHd5EVWYOjlEb3jeNYbfTuOE/edit?usp=sharing)  to display on a mobile device screen as a screensaver.  
  
The Director of the Marketing Department has commissioned a project for the Software Development team to develop the app. The Marketing Department plans to sell the app to OEM companies like Samsung, Apple, and Google to include in their standard set of screensavers for all new cell phones and tablets.  
  
As a Senior Python Developer on the Software Development team, my assignment is to create a service for the app that enables the app to calculate the current date based on the **number of cycles executed by the ball clock**.  
  
*Note: The Java team will create the rest of the services to calculate the time of day and the calendar date based on the information your service provides.  
The front end development team will create the app UI to use the services to display the clock with the date on the user screen.*

## Project Deliverables  
  
The deliverables for this project is a single class that simulates the rolling ball clock and calculates the number of days that elapse between ball sequence “resets” for clocks of varying sizes (with varying numbers of balls) that includes the following methods:  
  
- A method to simulate the operation of the clock  
  
- A method to calculate the elapsed time for a full clock cycle of 12 hours  
  
- A method to accept user input and display the result of the calculation  
  
The input from the terminal window will be a number between 27 and 127, representing the number of balls in a rolling ball clock.  
  
The output will be a sentence that explains the number of days that would elapse for a clock with the specified number of balls to “reset” the sequence of the balls, i.e., return all the balls to their original order in the pickup queue after calculated number of days.
